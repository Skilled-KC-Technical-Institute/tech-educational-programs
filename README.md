Tech-educational-programs is a registry of software development educational
resources for students and employers.

Technology programs are represented as a [directed acyclic graph network](https://mungingdata.com/python/dag-directed-acyclic-graph-networkx/).  This project, implemented in python, specifically uses [networkx](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/dag.html?highlight=dag#module-networkx.algorithms.dag) for this.
